**Hi! I'm Sam, a versatile software engineer with a focus on creating tangible impact.**

***About me***
My interest in computer science began when I was introduced to coding at an early age. What started as a casual hobby quickly grew into a passion. During my time at Lakehead University, I honed my skills in a diverse array of technologies and programming languages, including Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Swift, and Python, as well as frontend frameworks such as Angular and React. I am eager to secure my first role as a software engineer or full stack developer in a fast-growing company, where I can leverage my problem-solving, collaborative, and analytical skills. I have a strong interest in the Fintech and AI fields, as well as in startup ventures.
